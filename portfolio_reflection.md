# Portfolio Reflection

## What I Learned
Over the course of the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience across the full stack of modern software engineering. I learned how to design, build, and deploy applications that are cloud-ready, secure, and scalable. Key lessons included:
- **Cloud deployments**: Using AWS, Azure and containerization to deliver production-ready workloads.
- **AI/ML integration**: Experimenting with LLM demos and exploring hybrid ML/DL project ideas.
- **DevOps practices**: Building CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments, and managing secrets securely.
- **Low-code solutions**: Leveraging Power Apps and workflow automation to rapidly prototype business applications.
- **Data engineering**: Designing ETL workflows and applying SQL for structured insights.

## Technical Strengths
I am most confident in:
- **Full-stack development**: Building responsive front-end interfaces (HTML, CSS, Ionic-Angular, React) and robust back-end APIs (.NET, Python and Node.js).
- **Cloud-native design**: Deploying workloads with Docker Compose, Kubernetes/OpenShift, Azure and AWS.
- **Security-first architecture**: Applying OAuth 2.0 and modular repo structures to ensure trust and maintainability.
- **DevOps automation**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines and debugging orchestration issues for reproducibility.
- **Professional documentation**: Writing clear, structured guides in Markdown to support collaboration and onboarding.

## Capstone Integration
My Capstone Project demonstrates how these skills converge:
- **End-to-end delivery**: From front-end design to back-end APIs and cloud deployment.
- **Scalable architecture**: Containerized workloads orchestrated with Kubernetes/OpenShift.
- **AI/ML components**: Integrating intelligent features into a real-world application.
- **Trust-forward design**: Prioritizing user safety, clarity, and professional branding in UI/UX.

This project reflects my readiness for industry roles in **Cloud Engineering, AI/ML, DevOps, and Data Engineering**.

## Goals Moving Forward
Looking ahead, I plan to:
- **Advance Cloud Engineering**: Strengthen my expertise in cloud-native architectures, container orchestration, and multi-cloud deployments. PrepCheck’s deployment on Render highlights my ability to deliver scalable, production-ready applications, and I plan to extend this into serverless computing, advanced Kubernetes features, and secure cloud pipelines.
